    Euler diagrams are common and intuitive visualizations for data involving sets and
    relationships thereof. Compared to Venn diagrams , Euler diagrams do not require
    all set relationships to be present and may therefore be area-proportional also
    with subset or disjoint relationships in the input. Most Euler diagrams use
    circles, but circles do not always support accurate diagrams. A promising
    alternative for Euler diagrams is ellipses, which enable accurate diagrams for a
    wider range of set combinations. Ellipses, however, have not yet been implemented
    for more than three sets or three-set diagrams where there are disjoint or subset
    relationships. The aim of this thesis is to present a method and software for
    elliptical Euler diagrams for any number of sets. In this thesis, we provide and
    outline an R-based implementation called eulerr. It fits Euler diagrams using
    numerical optimization and exact-area algorithms through two steps: first, an
    initial layout is formed using the sets' pairwise relationships; second, this
    layout is finalized taking all the sets' intersections into account. Finally, we
    compare eulerr with other software implementations of Euler diagrams and show that
    the package is overall both more consistent and accurate as well as faster for up
    to seven sets compared to the other R-packages. eulerr perfectly reproduces samples
    of circular Euler diagrams as well as three-set diagrams with ellipses, but
    performs suboptimally with elliptical diagrams of more than three sets. eulerr also
    outperforms the other software tested in this thesis in fitting Euler diagrams to
    set configurations that might lack exact solutions provided that we use ellipses;
    eulerr's circular diagrams, meanwhile, fit better on all accounts save for the
    diagError metric in the case of three-set diagrams.

    Extracting relevant features from data sets where the number of observations n is
    much smaller then the number of predictors p is a major challenge in modern
    statistics. Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE)--a generalization of the
    lasso---is a promising method within this setting. Current numerical procedures for
    SLOPE, however, lack the efficiency that respective tools for the lasso enjoy,
    particularly in the context of estimating a complete regularization path. A key
    component in the efficiency of the lasso is predictor screening rules: rules that
    allow predictors to be discarded before estimating the model. This is the first
    paper to establish such a rule for SLOPE. We develop a screening rule for SLOPE by
    examining its subdifferential and show that this rule is a generalization of the
    strong rule for the lasso. Our rule is heuristic, which means that it may discard
    predictors erroneously. In our paper, however, we show that such situations are
    rare and easily safeguarded against by a simple check of the optimality conditions.
    Our numerical experiments show that the rule performs well in practice, leading to
    improvements by orders of magnitude for data in the p {$>>$} n domain, as well as
    incurring no additional computational overhead when n {\$>\$} p.

    The lasso is a popular method to induce shrinkage and sparsity in the solution
    vector (coefficients) of regression problems, particularly when there are many
    predictors relative to the number of observations. Solving the lasso in this
    high-dimensional setting can, however, be computationally demanding. Fortunately,
    this demand can be alleviated via the use of screening rules that discard
    predictors prior to fitting the model, leading to a reduced problem to be solved.
    In this paper, we present a new screening strategy: look-ahead screening. Our
    method uses safe screening rules to find a range of penalty values for which a
    given predictor cannot enter the model, thereby screening predictors along the
    remainder of the path. In experiments we show that these look-ahead screening rules
    outperform the active warm-start version of the Gap Safe rules.

    Numerical validation is at the core of machine learning research as it allows to
    assess the actual impact of new methods, and to confirm the agreement between
    theory and practice. Yet, the rapid development of the field poses several
    challenges: researchers are confronted with a profusion of methods to compare,
    limited transparency and consensus on best practices, as well as tedious
    re-implementation work. As a result, validation is often very partial, which can
    lead to wrong conclusions that slow down the progress of research. We propose
    Benchopt, a collaborative framework to automate, reproduce and publish optimization
    benchmarks in machine learning across programming languages and hardware
    architectures. Benchopt simplifies benchmarking for the community by providing an
    off-the-shelf tool for running, sharing and extending experiments. To demonstrate
    its broad usability, we showcase benchmarks on three standard learning tasks: \$
    \textbackslash ell\_2\$-regularized logistic regression, Lasso, and ResNet18
    training for image classification. These benchmarks highlight key practical
    findings that give a more nuanced view of the state-of-the-art for these problems,
    showing that for practical evaluation, the devil is in the details. We hope that
    Benchopt will foster collaborative work in the community hence improving the
    reproducibility of research findings.

    Predictor screening rules, which discard predictors from the design matrix before
    fitting a model, have had considerable impact on the speed with which
    l1-regularized regression problems, such as the lasso, can be solved. Current
    state-of-the-art screening rules, however, have difficulties in dealing with
    highly-correlated predictors, often becoming too conservative. In this paper, we
    present a new screening rule to deal with this issue: the Hessian Screening Rule.
    The rule uses second-order information from the model to provide more accurate
    screening as well as higher-quality warm starts. The proposed rule outperforms all
    studied alternatives on data sets with high correlation for both l1-regularized
    least-squares (the lasso) and logistic regression. It also performs best overall on
    the real data sets that we examine.
