  abstract = {Objectives Acute as well as chronic pain syndromes are common after whiplash trauma and exercise therapy is proposed as one possible intervention strategy. The aim of the present systematic review was to evaluate the effect of exercise therapy in patients with Whiplash-Associated Disorders for the improvement of neck pain and neck disability, compared with other therapeutic interventions, placebo interventions, no treatment, or waiting list. Content The review was registered in Prospero (CRD42017060356) and conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A literature search in PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane from inception until January 13, 2020 was combined with a hand search to identify eligible randomized controlled studies. Abstract screening, full text assessment and risk of bias assessment (Cochrane RoB 2.0) were conducted by two independent reviewers. Summary The search identified 4,103 articles. After removal of duplicates, screening of 2,921 abstracts and full text assessment of 100 articles, 27 articles that reported data for 2,127 patients were included. The included articles evaluated the effect of exercise therapy on neck pain, neck disability or other outcome measures and indicated some positive effects from exercise, but many studies lacked control groups not receiving active treatment. Studies on exercise that could be included in the random-effect meta-analysis showed significant short-term effects on neck pain and medium-term effects on neck disability. Outlook Despite a large number of articles published in the area of exercise therapy and Whiplash-Associated Disorders, the current evidence base is weak. The results from the present review with meta-analysis suggests that exercise therapy may provide additional effect for improvement of neck pain and disability in patients with Whiplash-Associated Disorders.},

  abstract = {Euler diagrams are common and intuitive visualizations for data involving sets and relationships thereof. Compared to Venn diagrams, Euler diagrams do not require all set relationships to be present and may therefore be area-proportional also with subset or disjoint relationships in the input. Most Euler diagrams use circles, but circles do not always support accurate diagrams. A promising alternative for Euler diagrams is ellipses, which enable accurate diagrams for a wider range of set combinations. Ellipses, however, have not yet been implemented for more than three sets or three-set diagrams where there are disjoint or subset relationships. The aim of this thesis is to present a method and software for elliptical Euler diagrams for any number of sets. In this thesis, we provide and outline an R-based implementation called eulerr. It fits Euler diagrams using numerical optimization and exact-area algorithms through two steps: first, an initial layout is formed using the sets' pairwise relationships; second, this layout is finalized taking all the sets' intersections into account. Finally, we compare eulerr with other software implementations of Euler diagrams and show that the package is overall both more consistent and accurate as well as faster for up to seven sets compared to the other R-packages. eulerr perfectly reproduces samples of circular Euler diagrams as well as three-set diagrams with ellipses, but performs suboptimally with elliptical diagrams of more than three sets. eulerr also outperforms the other software tested in this thesis in fitting Euler diagrams to set configurations that might lack exact solutions provided that we use ellipses; eulerr's circular diagrams, meanwhile, fit better on all accounts save for the diagError metric in the case of three-set diagrams.},

Our numerical experiments show that the rule performs well in practice, leading to improvements by orders of magnitude for data in the \$p \textbackslash gg n\$ domain, as well as incurring no additional computational overhead when \$n \textbackslash gg p\$. We also examine the effect of correlation structures in the design matrix on the rule and discuss algorithmic strategies for employing the rule.

  abstract = {The lasso is a popular method to induce shrinkage and sparsity in the solution vector (coefficients) of regression problems, particularly when there are many predictors relative to the number of observations. Solving the lasso in this high-dimensional setting can, however, be computationally demanding. Fortunately, this demand can be alleviated via the use of screening rules that discard predictors prior to fitting the model, leading to a reduced problem to be solved. In this paper, we present a new screening strategy: look-ahead screening. Our method uses safe screening rules to find a range of penalty values for which a given predictor cannot enter the model, thereby screening predictors along the remainder of the path. In experiments we show that these look-ahead screening rules outperform the active warm-start version of the Gap Safe rules.},

  abstract = {Predictor screening rules, which discard predictors from the design matrix before fitting a model, have had sizable impacts on the speed with which \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$-regularized regression problems, such as the lasso, can be solved. Current state-of-the-art screening rules, however, have difficulties in dealing with highly-correlated predictors, often becoming too conservative. In this paper, we present a new screening rule to deal with this issue: the Hessian Screening Rule. The rule uses second-order information from the model in order to provide more accurate screening as well as higher-quality warm starts. In our experiments on \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$-regularized least-squares (the lasso) and logistic regression, we show that the rule outperforms all other alternatives in simulated experiments with high correlation, as well as in the majority of real datasets that we study.},
